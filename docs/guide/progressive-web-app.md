# Progressive web app

Currently Ream caches all the static files that are generated by webpack, like `.js` `.css` files.

Our next steps are:

- Cache `index.html`. As soon as you visit the page once Ream would install a service worker which serves an app shell on any subsequent visit.
- Add `manifest.json`.
- Add corresponding HTML tags.
